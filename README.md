# Data Structures and Algorithms

In this subject the objective was to:
* Learn about different data structures such as: Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Graphs,..etc.
* Get familiarized with different algorithms such as: Dijkstra, Binary Tree Searching, Sorting,...etc.
* Get familiarized with Object Oriented Programming

It consisted of two project, two partial tests and a final test

## Project 1: Singly Linked List
In this project the goal was to implement methods to:
* Delete the largest sequence of consecutive repeated elements in the linked list.
* Detects and removes a loop within the linked list (if one exists).
* Creates a loop in the linked list at a specified position (for testing purposes).

## Project 2: Binary Search Tree
In this project the goal was to implement methods to:
* Finds all nodes within a given tree that are at a distance 'k' from a target node 'n'.
* Finds the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes 'a' and 'b' within the binary search tree.
* Calculates the distance between a node 'temp' and another node 'a' within the tree.
